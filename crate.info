# About this crate

This library is a Rust implementation for communicating with a MFRC522 board
from a microcontroller that runs Linux (BeagleBone, Raspberry Pi, ...).  
It is based on the [C++ rfid library](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid) by Miguel Balboa,
which in turn is based on code by Dr. Leong and has been extended by SÃ¸ren Thing Andersen and Tom Clement.  

This code is released into the public domain.
